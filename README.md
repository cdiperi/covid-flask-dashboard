# covid-flask-dashboard

This web app was a personal project that was designed to provide up-to-date information regarding COVID-19 cases worldwide. The data is pulled from a REST API (https://github.com/novelcovid/api) that compiles data from multiple sources, primarily the World Health Organization, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and Johns Hopkins University. The data pulled from this API updates several times per hour.

The visualizations in this web app were made using Bokeh 2.0.0. 

This web app can be viewed at http://covid19.cdiperi.com.
